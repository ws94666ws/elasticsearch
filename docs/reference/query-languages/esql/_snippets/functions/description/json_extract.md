## Description

Extracts a value from a JSON string using a subset of [JSONPath](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9535) syntax.

Paths can use dot notation (`user.address.city`), bracket
notation (`['user']['address']['city']`), or a mix of both
(`user['address'].city`). For simple keys, dot notation and
bracket notation are interchangeable — `a.b` and `a['b']`
produce the same result.

Bracket notation is required for keys that contain dots or
special characters (`['user.name']`), for empty string keys
(`['']`), and for array indices (`items[0]`). Dots in dot
notation are always path separators per the JSONPath
specification — a JSON key that literally contains a dot
(e.g., `"user.name"`) must be accessed via bracket notation.
The JSONPath `$` root selector is supported for compatibility
but is always optional — `$.name` and `name` are equivalent,
and `$[0]` and `[0]` are equivalent. Optional whitespace is
allowed inside brackets (`[ 0 ]` is equivalent to `[0]`).
Path matching is case-sensitive per the JSON specification.

The extracted value is returned as a `keyword` string: string
values without surrounding quotes, numbers and booleans as their
string representation, and objects or arrays as JSON strings.
Returns `null` if either parameter is `null` or if the extracted
JSON value is `null`.

Returns `null` and emits a warning if the input is not valid JSON,
the path is malformed, the path does not exist, the array index is
out of bounds, or the path attempts to traverse through a
non-object/non-array value.

This function does not support wildcards (`*`), recursive descent
(`..`), array slicing (`[0:3]`), filter expressions
(`?(@.price<10)`), or negative array indices (`[-1]`).
